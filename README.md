# PiPython
Teaching myself Python on the Raspberry Pi

This is morphing into the initial though process for valance lighting controlled by the Pi. Currently can read stored color sequences for an RGB LED strip from either a JSON file on disc or from Azure Table Storage.

# TODO
* Add ability to create and store new sequences
* Move from Azure Table Storage to Azure DocumentDB?
* Add support for Azure Service Bus for broadcasting requests to start, stop, or modify a sequence
